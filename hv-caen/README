To compile hvmon:

 gcc -Wall -lcaenhvwrapper -lpthread -ldl -lm -o hv-caen hv-caen.c
 gcc -Wall -lm -o hv-caen-read hv-caen-read.c

Currently, it uses snmp to contact MPOD IP addresses
and CAENHVWrapper calls to contact CAEN HV 1527 systems.
When other CAEN systems are needed, the .conf file and hvptr->
structure of the mapped memory should gain a caen system flag
for each channel.
