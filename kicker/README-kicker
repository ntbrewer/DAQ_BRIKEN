For USB-serial on Linux: /dev/ttyUSBx where x=0,1,2,....

Driver for Prolific 2303 USB-Serial in kernel for 2.4.? and higher

Make sure ttyUSBx has rw privlege for others...ie., chmod o+rw ttyUSBx
- root owns it so root has to do this

For USB-serial on Mac 10.6: /dev/tty.usbserial 
Presumably numbers are added for multiple devices

Driver for Prolific 2303 USB-Serial must be downloaded from Prolific
website: http://www.prolific.com.tw/eng/downloads.asp?id=31

If problems, check privleges though I did not have to do that as
I plugged it in, so apple automatically gave me access as owner
